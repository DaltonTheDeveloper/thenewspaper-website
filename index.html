                  The goal isn’t to chase every outrage cycle. It’s to give you a

                  the courts, the White House, and the broader system.

                  Under the hood, we use an AI research assistant to sift through
                  real reporting across outlets and wire services. Then we apply a
                  fixed set of rules so the daily briefing is consistent,
                  transparent, and bias-aware.
